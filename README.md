# OpenMMArm-qingqing
This project is based on the [qingqing project](https://gitee.com/qingqing-gaq/light_lift_arm_6dof), but we adjusted it during our reproduction process to fit our requirements. Our current focus is to resolve compiler warnings and enhance the VS Code `clangd` experience.

- 2025-10-15: Updated `CMakeLists.txt` to address build warnings and optimize VS Code `clangd` usage.
- 2025-10-17: Refined the lower-level controller information validation mechanism.
